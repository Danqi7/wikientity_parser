Several hundred thousand dollars in capital was raised during that time period for construction and modernization on the Gold Coast (British colony) through the stock market, and infrastructure metal deals were made with companies such as U.S. Steel. In the beginning of Chappelle's business, he was reported to have made contracts with 82 tribal chiefs in Gold Coast, West Africa, for the exportation of gold, cocoa, rubber, and mahogany. The money was to be used to develop 440 miles with the African Central Railroad and the West Coast Steam and Harbor Company, both African-American and African joint ventures."

(S'The Hebrew Technical School for Girls was a vocational school whose goal was to provide free instruction for women to pursue jobs in commercial and industrial sectors. It was founded in 1880 as the Louis Down-Town Sabbath and Day School by the educator Minnie Dessau Louis (1841-1922). It was founded with the assistance of Temple Emanu-el for "the express purpose of elevating working-class Jewish immigrant girls." Their building was located at 240 Second Avenue in Manhattan, New York City.\nThe school had two divisions. The Commercial Department provided courses in stenography, typewriting, bookkeeping, English, penmanship, commercial arithmetic and geography. The Manual Department, intended for those going into millenary or dress making, offered courses in sewing, millenary, embroidery, drawing and costume design.\nIn 1892, Lillian Wald, a 25-year-old nurse then enrolled in the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Medical College, volunteered to teach a class on home health care for immigrant women at the Louis Down-Town Sabbath and Daily School. Because of her encounters there, she eventually founded the Nurses\' Settlement, which eventually became the Henry Street Settlement.\nThe school closed in 1932, as New York City public schools began to offer similar courses. The charity renamed itself the Jewish Foundation for Education of Women, and provided grants for undergraduate and graduate study. The building now houses the Manhattan Comprehensive Night and Day School.'
